All issues seem worse with OSMesa, at least as I have built it for my local desktop.

Pseudocolor plot:
  1) curve3d -- entire arch is black (lighting/normals incorrect?)
     -dump output matches visit trunk, so is somewhere in the rendering.
     *I exported the silo file to vtk, and created a simple vtk pipeline.
      It renders correctly in the vtk stand alone program.

Mesh Plot:
  1)  Point glyphs (geometry, like boxes) not drawn in OSMesa context
      eg OSMesa enabled/built and SaveWindow.  (but tensor plots, which are also glyphed, ARE being drawn ... what's the difference here?)

Curve Plot:
   'Labels' appear in correct spot but not curve. OSMESA offsreen not drawn.
   Utilizes multiple renders of same data:
   lines and/or
   points (glyphed or not) and/or
   fill and/or
   time cue as ball or line
   
Label Plot:  
   Not good 

Spreadsheep Plot:  slice part in the render window is black.

Surface Plot:
   Not being drawn at all : probably due to custom mapper/renderer
   But I think this plot can be removed altogether??

Truecolor Plot:
   With OSMesa, Not being drawn at all.

Vector Plot:
   Not receiving shading ? 
   Also, other problems with test #11, #13

Volume Plot:
   Splatting: black
   Texturing: black
   SLIVR:  takes very long time to render a frame
 
   OSMESA Not being drawn at all : probably due to custom mapper/renderer
